### Project Number



### Description

The Riverview Branch Library, located at 10509 Riverview Drive, is one of about 30 library facilities under Hillsborough County’s City-County Public Library system. At 8,000 square feet and 35 years old, the current building is considered outdated and too small for the increased customer use that has accompanied new development in the area in recent years.

Hillsborough County is seeking feedback from residents on what kinds of future amenities and improvements they would like to see, how they feel about the current location versus a different site, and whether there is interest in housing other County services – or perhaps even a private venture – as part of the library facility.

Input from the community is vital to shaping the project scope, which in turn will identify a construction timeline and final costs.

### What to Expect



### Cost & Funding

During the fiscal year 2015 budget process, County Commissioners approved $3.4 million in capital improvement funds to begin work on the project to expand or replace the building. A complete cost will be projected once the final scope of the project is determined.

### Timeline

To be determined once the final scope of the project is decided.
