### Project Number



### Description

Constructed in 1956, the old Gandy Bridge carried westbound traffic across Old Tampa Bay until 1995 when a new westbound bridge was opened. The old bridge began a new life as the 2.6-mile recreational Friendship Trailbridge in 1999, creating a linear park spanning between Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. In 2008, structural engineers determined the aging bridge structure was no longer safe for pedestrians and the entire span was closed. The American Bridge Company has been contracted to systematically deconstruct the Friendship Trailbridge. The bridge demolition will primarily take place using equipment staged on barges to remove large segments of the bridge.

### What to Expect

* Permitting and Mobilization of Equipment - August 20th through December 7th notice to mariners will be broadcast by the United States Coast Guard. The demolition contractor will deploy buoys along the bridge demarking construction zone- 300 feet off the bridge face on both sides for the full length of bridge. Temporary construction fence will encapsulate the existing parking lots at both ends of the bridge, effectively closing the lots to the public.
* Removal of Handrail, Light Poles, Bronze Plaques - Light poles will be removed by crane barge with the crane loading the material onto barges. Handrail will be removed from the structure by either crane barge or pick-up truck and trailer. Both poles and handrails are expected to be salvaged. Bronze plaques will be removed by hand and returned to Hillsborough and Pinellas counties.
* Removal of Catwalk - Catwalks will be cut into manageable pieces and lifted on to barges by crane barge. All material will be loaded onto barges and transported for disposal.
* Removal of center spans - Spans will be cut into manageable pieces and removed by crane barge. Columns and caps will be cut into manageable pieces and removed by crane barge. All material will be loaded onto barges and transported for disposal.
* Removal of 72-foot spans - Span removal will start toward center of the bridge and advance landward on both sides of the bridge. Spans will be cut into manageable pieces and removed by crane barge. Columns and caps will be cut into manageable pieces and removed by crane barge. Piles will be removed by crane barge. All material will be loaded onto barges and transported for disposal.
* Removal of 48-foot spans - Span removal will start toward center of the bridge and advance landward on both sides of the bridge. Spans will be cut into manageable pieces and removed by crane barge. Caps and piles will be removed by crane barge. All material will be loaded onto barges and transported for disposal.

### Cost & Funding

The $9.35 million construction project is being funded by Hillsborough County.

### Timeline

* The demolition project is scheduled to beginning in the fall of 2015 and take approximately 16 months.
* Regular demolition activity will occur Monday-Friday, from 7 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

### Additional Information

* All debris from the bridge will be transported via barge to the demolition contractor's facility. At the facility, the material will be processed and transported to a recycler for use as road base and aggregates.
* The project will follow the American Bridge corporate safety plan and target zero safety incidents.
* American Bridge will follow all permit requirements, deploy turbidity barriers when necessary, and take caution to ensure no seagrass beds are effected by construction boat and barge traffic.
* At the abutments, construction fences will be installed to prohibit public traffic in the construction zone.
