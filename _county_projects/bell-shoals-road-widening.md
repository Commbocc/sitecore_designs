### Number

### Description

The project consists of widening Bell Shoals Road from a two-lane, undivided rural road, to a four-lane, divided urban facility. The project extends approximately 3.1 miles from just south of the Alafia River to north of Bloomingdale Avenue. The corridor will have two 12-foot lanes for vehicles, a 4-foot bike lane, and sidewalks in both directions. The proposed design will include widening the existing bridge over the Alafia River. This project also will improve the traffic signals at Glenhaven Drive, Rosemead Lane and Bloomingdale Avenue.

The new design will increase the level of service along Bell Shoals Road, accommodating higher traffic volumes while maximizing safety along the corridor.

### What to Expect

* The work will involve heavy equipment and excavation, and will generate normal construction nise.
* In some areas, traffic lane closures may be necessary. For the safety of the workers, pedestrians and other motorists, please observe all traffic control measures.
* Construction will be in the right of way; however, at times it will be necessary to work on private property. All areas affected by the construction will be restored.
* There will be extensive traffic control measures implemented during the construction. Please observe all traffic signs and be aware of potential shifts in traffic patterns.
* Excavation work can sometimes cause an accidental water pipeline break or similar problem. As required by the Hillsborough County Health Department, instructions for a precautionary boil water notice will be issued for any water service interruption.

### Cost & Funding

The $65 million construction project is being funded by Newland Communities and Hillsborough County.

All right of way acquisition is being processed and paid for by Hillsborough County. The bridge construction at the Alafia River and Bloomingdale Intersection improvements are also funded by Hillsborough County. All other design and construction costs related to the project will be funded by Newland Communities.

### Timeline

Construction is expected to begin in 2016 and be finished within 36 months.
