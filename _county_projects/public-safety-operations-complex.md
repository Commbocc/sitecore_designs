### Project Number



### Description

The project includes design and construction of a new facility that will replace Hillsborough County’s Fire Rescue headquarters and Emergency Operations Center, currently located on Hanna Avenue in Tampa. Located at 9450 E. Columbus Drive in the Brandon area, the 52,000-square-foot main building will house Fire Rescue’s administrative staff and training center, Emergency Dispatch, and the Office of Emergency Management. The building will be the center of County government’s functions to monitor, prepare and respond to emergencies and public safety incidents. Also to be constructed on the site are a 10,000-square-foot fleet operations area for Fire Rescue, and a 15,500-square-foot warehouse.

### What to Expect

Existing Fire Rescue services will remain in operation during the completion of the new station. Personnel, equipment and apparatus have been moved to temporary quarters on site.

### Cost & Funding

Construction costs for the complex are approximately $36.1 million. Funding is through General Revenue and Public Safety Improvement Bond Project Funds.
