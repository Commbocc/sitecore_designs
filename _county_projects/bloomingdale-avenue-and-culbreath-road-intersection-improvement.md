title: Bloomingdale Avenue and Culbreath Road Intersection Improvement
---

### Project Number



### Description

The intersection improvement area consists of approximately 1,930 feet, extending approximately 650 feet west and 800 feet east of Culbreath Road and 480 feet south of Bloomingdale Avenue. The project will include the construction of an exclusive eastbound right-turn lane, and additional westbound and northbound left-turn lanes at the intersection. The existing signalized intersection will also be upgraded from the current concrete pole and span-wire configuration to a steel pole and mast arm configuration. Additional improvements will include ADA compliant sidewalks installed at the intersection corners and 4-foot bike lanes constructed on both sides of Bloomingdale Avenue. On Culbreath Road, just south of the YMCA entrance, the County will be constructing bus bays on both sides of the road.

### What to Expect

* Temporary traffic lane closure and slowdown of traffic through the intersection.
* Construction will generally take place on weekdays between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. However, possible night time work maybe expected to perform necessary construction operation.
* The work will involve heavy equipment and excavation, and will generate normal construction noise.
* Access to businesses will be maintained throughout construction.
* In some areas, traffic lane closures may be necessary. For the safety of the workers, pedestrians and other motorists, please observe all traffic control measures.
* Most construction will be in the right of way; however, at times it will be necessary to work on private property. All areas affected by the construction will be restored.
* Excavation work can sometimes cause an accidental water pipeline break or similar problem. As required by the Hillsborough County Health Department, instructions for a precautionary boil water notice will be issued for any water service interruption.
* Temporary relocation of the area bus stop is expected during the construction of the bus bays on Culbreath Road.

### Cost & Funding

The project has been funded with Capital Improvement Surtax Phase III Funds. The estimated construction cost is expected to be $1.4 million.

### Timeline

* A pre-construction Public Information Meeting was held on Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015.                       
* Construction is expected to begin in January 2016 and be completed in mid-2016.
