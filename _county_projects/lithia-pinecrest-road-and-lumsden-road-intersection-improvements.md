type: transportation
---

### Project Number



### Description

The traffic pattern will remain the same on all the major approaches. To improve safety, Durant will be converted to right in / right out traffic only and the traffic separator will be extended on Lithia, south of the Lumsden intersection. In addition a traffic separator will be added to Lumsden Road, east of the intersection.   

The proposed improvements include the following:   


* For the southbound approach on Lithia Pinecrest Road
	* The addition of a right turn lane, an additional left turn lane and an additional through lane.
	* Add raised medians and concrete traffic separators.

* For the northbound approach on Lithia Pinecrest Road
	* Add an additional through lane, an additional left turn lane.
	* Remove the existing temporary traffic channelizer and replace it with a concrete traffic separator that runs the full length of the left turn lanes.
	* Bicycle lanes will be installed on both the north and southbound approaches.

* For the eastbound approach on Lumsden Road
	* Add an additional through lane, an additional right turn lane and extend the length of the existing right turn lane.
	* Extend the length of the existing left turn lane. 
	* Replace the existing medians and traffic separators.

* For the westbound approach on Lumsden Road
	* Add a right turn lane and extend the length of the existing left turn lane.
	* Add raised medians and concrete traffic separators. 
	* Modify the connection of Durant Road and Lumsden Road to a right-in / right-out only configuration.

In addition the existing traffic signals and poles will be replaced and sidewalks will be added or replaced to improve pedestrian connectivity through the corridor.

### What to Expect

* The work will involve heavy equipment and excavation, and will generate normal construction noise.
* Access to businesses will be maintained throughout construction.
* In some areas, traffic lane closures may be necessary. For the safety of the workers, pedestrians and other motorists, please observe all traffic control measures.
* Most construction will be in the right of way; however, at times it will be necessary to work on private property. All areas affected by the construction will be restored.

### Cost & Funding

The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $11.6 million and funded through the Public Works Capital Improvement Program.

### Timeline

* Roadway design and permitting is complete.
* Right-of-way acquisition, needed to support the additional through and turn lanes, is scheduled for completion late 2015.
* Construction is expected to begin in early 2016 and be completed in approximately 30 months.
