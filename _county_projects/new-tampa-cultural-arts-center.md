### Project Number



### Description

Hillsborough County is soliciting for a Public Private Partnership (P3) for the development of the New Tampa Community Park at a 13.4- acre County-owned property located on the Northwest side of Bruce B. Downs Boulevard, west of Hunter’s Green Boulevard in the New Tampa area of Hillsborough County. The property is designated as “New Tampa Community Park” for a future park/cultural center.

The County has not established funding or a budget for the development of the property. The intent is to seek creative and competitive proposals for a Public-Private Partnership (P3) through this solicitation and to enter into a P3 agreement whereby the County will make available the vacant parcel of property fronting on Bruce B. Downs Boulevard for possible commercial development in conjunction with a park/cultural center/community center. The developer will fund, design and construct the development to the extent it deems feasible for a viable, marketable development, while meeting the needs of the citizens of the community and providing equal value to the County in exchange for the property.

### Public Meeting

The County is in the process of determining community desire for a P3 Development of the property and to obtain feedback from the citizens with regard to the proposals which are expected to be received on September 4, 2014. Citizens have previously expressed a desire for the process to be transparent and to have an opportunity to review the plans as they are developed. The purpose of this meeting is to have the proposers present their development proposals to the public so that the public will have the opportunity to review and provide input on the proposals prior to evaluation/scoring. Based on the public comments and evaluation/scoring, the County will decide if the project should move forward.
