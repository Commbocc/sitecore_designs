### Project Number



### Description

The C. Blythe Andrews, Jr. Public Library, located at 2607 E. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., is one of about 30 library facilities under Hillsborough County’s City-County Public Library system. At approximately 8,500 square feet, the current building is considered too small for the number of customers who use the facility.

Hillsborough County is seeking feedback from residents on what kinds of future amenities and improvements they would like to see in an expanded or new building, and whether there is interest in housing other County services with the library. The library will remain on the same site.

Input from the community is vital to shaping the project scope, which in turn will identify a construction timeline and final costs.

### What to Expect



### Cost & Funding

During the fiscal year 2015 budget process, County Commissioners approved $3.4 million in capital improvement funds to begin work on the project to expand or replace the existing library. A complete cost will be projected once the final scope of the project is determined.

### Timeline

To be determined once the final scope of the project is decided.
