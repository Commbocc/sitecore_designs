### Project Number



### Description

The intersection of Gunn Highway and Linebaugh Avenue has been recognized by the County’s Department of Public Works as a location that experiences significant vehicle delay due to traffic congestion and a high number of vehicle crashes, and currently operates at an unacceptable level of service during peak hours due to inadequate turn lane capacity.

Construction of improvements to the intersection include, but are not limited to, additional right turn lanes eastbound and westbound along Linebaugh Avenue, an additional left turn lane along northbound Gunn Highway, and a longer left turn lane along southbound Gunn Highway. Improvements also include providing traffic separators, pavement widening and resurfacing, drainage improvements, pedestrian safety features, adding 8-foot multiuse sidewalks, bike lanes and a new traffic signal system.

After construction is completed the overall traffic safety and operation of this intersection will be improved for motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists.

### What to Expect

* Temporary traffic lane closures and slowdown of traffic through the intersection. Lane closures may occur during the day or at night depending on the construction operation. Construction will take place predominately on weekdays during the day and night.
* The work will involve heavy equipment and excavation, and will generate normal construction noise.
* Access to businesses will be maintained throughout construction.
* In some areas, traffic lane closures may be necessary. For the safety of the workers, pedestrians and other motorists, please observe all traffic control measures.
* Most construction will be in the right of way; however, at times it may be necessary to work on private property with prior approval. All areas affected by the construction will be restored.
* Excavation work can sometimes cause an accidental water pipeline break or similar problem. Should any water service interruption occur, instructions for a precautionary boil water notice will be issued.

### Cost & Funding

The $3.6 million project is being funded through the Public Works Capital Improvement Transportation Program, including the Community Investment Tax Phase III Transportation Task Force Project Fund and a $1.65 million grant thru the Florida Department of Transportation Local Agency Program.
