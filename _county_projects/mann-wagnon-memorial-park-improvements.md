### Project Number

C83236000

### Description

Design and Construction of Mann-Wagnon Memorial Park Improvements, which include the construction of a new 4,000 square foot Multi-Purpose Community Center together with site improvements. These include a Passive Park, parking lot, hardscape areas, landscaping, utilities and related drainage systems. This project is located at 1101 River Cove Drive, in the Sulphur Springs neighborhood, within the City of Tampa. The site is approximately 2.00 acres in size.

The proposed 4,000 square foot Multi-Purpose Community Center is intended for use by three private, Non-Profit Groups, through leases with the County. In 2010 the six onsite buildings were assigned to the Groups: Community Stepping Stones, Moses House and Sulphur Springs Museum. These existing buildings suffer from various levels of structural damage and deterioration and do not meet current Code requirements; additionally several of them are located in the 100-year Flood Plain. These deficient buildings must be demolished except for the block building, to remain for shared storage.

* The Architectural design is in keeping with the Residential scale and look of the Sulphur Springs Community, with its metal roof and lap siding commonly found throughout the neighborhood. The exterior walls are recessed to further provide architectural interest, as well as providing shade from large roof overhangs.
