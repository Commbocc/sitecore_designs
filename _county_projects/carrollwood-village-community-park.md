### Project Number



### Description

The purpose of this project is to acquire approximately 50 acres of the former Dale Mabry Wastewater Treatment Plant site and develop the land into a community park. This project will be produced in phases and will involve land acquisition, project development, design, and construction. Proposed park infrastructure for Phase I includes site work, landscaping, potable and reclaimed water, electric/power, irrigation, roadways, paving, building renovation, new construction, and signage. Recommended amenities include a walking/jogging trail, playground, dog park, plant/butterfly garden, and other miscellaneous park equipment/fixtures. This project will be explored for possible public-private partnership opportunities.

The Hillsborough County Public Utilities Department plans to surplus most of the property, and the Carrollwood Village community has requested the project. It will serve as a community project while engaging and enhancing the community area.
